This directory contains the tools required to automatically generate Word Zombies levels.

=== run.sh ===
The only script which needs to be run. It groups together everything in one process. Just run
this to create some new levels.

The level creation process is fully automated and random. Just run the above script with the 
specified parameters, and new levels will appear. The levels will be progressively more diffcult. 
Difficulty is based on the word frequency and length, and the speed of the zombie. Different
Zombie types will also be used from the ones available (see create_levels.php).

Other Files:

=== source.txt ===
The source for gathering word data and information. Frankenstein is used as the example, but any
book can be used in it's place.

=== prepare_wz_dict.py ===
This program takes in the source and will produce an output listing the words, lengths and 
frequencies that were in the input. Lengths and word frequency are used to determine their
difficulty when creating levels.

=== create_levels.php ===
This will take all the available data and create some random levels. It does all the heavy lifting.
