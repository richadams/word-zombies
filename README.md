Built in 24 hours at the first Gravity Mobile Hackathon in 2011, Word Zombies is a HTML5/JS game (using <a href="http://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>) where you try to kill zombies by typing the words that appear above them. Each key press is a gunshot; if it's the next letter above the zombie, it hits, otherwise it misses. Make sure you get all the letters before the zombies get to you though!

The levels were generated by reading in some words (the novel Frankenstein), making the "difficulty" of each word (based on length and how frequent it is), then generating each level in such a way that they should get harder and harder. In reality, it's pretty difficult to get past the first few levels, so the level generator might need some tweaking.
